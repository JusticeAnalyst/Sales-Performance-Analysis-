## Insight
•	YoY% COGS (Cost of Goods Sold): -14.56%.
•	YoY% Revenue:-11.57%.
•	YoY% Profit:-6.60%.
1.	All the Key Metrics Declined YOY%: You are seeing a decrease in Revenue, COGS, and profit, which indicate overall lower business activity compared to the previous year.
2.	COGS declined more than Revenues: COGS dropped by 14.56%, while revenues declined by 11.57%.
(a).	The suggested costs were reduced more significantly than the drop in revenue, which could indicate better cost control or lower production/output needs
3. Profit Declined the least(-6.60%):
(a).	This shows that although revenue dropped, the business was able to preserve more of its profit margin through effective cost management.
(b).	In other words, profitability efficiency improved, even though the absolute figures decreased.
## Recommendation
1. Investigate revenue decline:
(a).	Understand why revenue dropped. was it due to lower sales volume, lower prices, reduced market demand or increased competition
(b).	Look into product lines, customer segments, and sales channels to identify where the biggest drop happened.
2. Sustain and enhance cost efficiency:
(a).	The improvement in cost-to-revenue ratio is a positive sign. Look into what contributed to the cost reduction- supply chain optimization, supplier negotiation, operational    
     efficiencies and consider how you can sustain or scale that.
3.	Strengthen marketing & scale Strategy:
   If cost management is under focus should be on growing revenue again through:
(a).	Argent marketing campaigns
(b).	New customer acquisition
(c).	Upselling or cross-selling to existing customers 
4.	Monitor Profit Quality:
(a).	Ensure that the maintained profit isn't solely due to cost-cutting in critical areas like R&D, customer service, or marketing, which could hurt long-term growth.
